# Welcome to the HumanAnime Project

The purpose of this project is to create a cycleGAN network in Keras to produce anime style faces from humans. The datasets consist of a number of celebrity faces and a large collectiion of anime faces. To follow the code in the notebook provided within this repository please upload the data to your current working directory:

The aritechture that is adopted within this notebook is taken from the cycleGAN [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf) proposed by Zhu et. al. CycleGAN has been shown to have visually impressive results without the need for paired training examples, which are often expensive to obtain. It builds on the architecture of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) by adding a cycle consistancy loss to preserve the input mapping. The project website is available to explore [here](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/).
